This project, *Data-Driven Strategies for Boosting Customer Retention via ATM Performance Optimization*, explores how advanced analytics can be harnessed to solve a critical challenge in modern banking: customer retention. In a landscape where financial institutions compete on convenience and reliability, ATMs remain one of the most essential yet often overlooked customer touchpoints. By applying Business Intelligence and data analytics to ATM performance data, this initiative uncovers patterns in user behavior, identifies inefficiencies in service delivery, and generates actionable insights to improve uptime and responsiveness. The objective is clear‚Äîoptimize ATM operations to directly enhance the customer experience and, in turn, drive loyalty and long-term retention. What sets this project apart is its strategic use of data not just to monitor operations, but to influence decision-making that improves customer satisfaction at scale. By translating complex data into targeted improvements, this work demonstrates how institutions can move from reactive problem-solving to proactive service design‚Äîcreating a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving digital economy.

## [Credit Risk Assessment with Data From Raw Numbers to Smart Decisions](https://github.com/judoski366/Credit-Risk-Assessment-with-Data-From-Raw-Numbers-to-Smart-Decisions/blob/main/README.md)

Assessing credit risk has long been a critical yet complex challenge for financial institutions. With the surge in available applicant data, there's a significant opportunity to shift from traditional evaluation methods to more intelligent, data-driven decision-making. This project demonstrates how structured analytics‚Äîguided by the six stages of data analysis (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act)‚Äîcan be applied to credit risk evaluation using Microsoft SQL Server. By exploring and transforming a dataset containing borrower attributes such as income, employment status, credit history, and loan amount, I built a robust rule-based model to assess applicant risk. Through optimized SQL queries, the raw data was cleaned, segmented, and analyzed to surface meaningful patterns and key risk indicators. Although no machine learning techniques were used, the model employs calculated risk factors and logical conditions to generate customer profiles that support confident lending decisions. This analysis showcases how powerful insights can be achieved through thoughtful data handling and SQL alone‚Äîmaking a strong case for practical, scalable credit risk solutions in real-world financial environments.

Nigeria, often referred to as the ‚ÄúGiant of Africa,‚Äù is a major oil-producing nation‚Äîyet rising fuel prices continue to place a heavy burden on its citizens. As global oil markets fluctuate, many Nigerians are forced to grapple with the question: how affordable is fuel in an oil-rich country compared to others around the world? This project explores the **economic reality of fuel affordability** in Nigeria by examining how fuel prices interact with wages and working hours, and how this compares across selected countries, both oil-producing and non-oil-producing. Using the six stages of data analysis‚ÄîAsk, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act‚ÄîI investigated the relationship between **minimum wage, fuel cost, and the number of hours the average citizen must work to afford one liter of petrol**. The goal is to shed light on the real-life implications of fuel affordability for everyday Nigerians and to understand how this challenge fits into a global context. By leveraging thoughtful data analysis, this project uncovers the deeper socioeconomic impact of fuel pricing and wages‚Äîinsights that are vital for shaping policy, improving economic equity, and empowering citizens in energy-rich nations like Nigeria.
